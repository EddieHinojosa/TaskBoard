## About The Project

<p>This Task Board will help you stay organized by providing easy to view columns, color coded boxes for easy to view which tasks require more attention.<br>
Allows to input your title, description of the task, as well as a deadline calendar.
</p>


## How It Works:

<p>Click the "Add Task", input the title, a brief description fo the task at hand, and when the due date falls on. <br>
Once you hvae started on a task, you can drag the task over from the "To Do" column over to the "In Progress" or even the "Done" column. <br>
IF a task is no longer needed, use the "Delete" button that is at the bottom of each task created </p>
